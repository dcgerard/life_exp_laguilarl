# Abstract

Here, I re-examine the analysis of Oeppen and Vaupel (2002).

# Analysis


```{r cars}

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
